# Liquidity Pool

[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)


Users can participate in a liquidity protocol as depositors and borrowers. Users
that would like to earn passive income can provide liquidity to the pool and earn
interest on top of the assets provided, they are the depositors. Users that want
to borrow money from the pool in a collateralised way are called the borrowers.
